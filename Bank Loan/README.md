## Bank Loan Analysis Power BI Project
Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis Power BI project repository! This project aims to provide insightful analysis and visualization of bank loan data using Power BI.

## Overview
This Power BI project analyzes various aspects of bank loans to provide valuable insights for decision-making. It comprises three main dashboards: Summary, Overview, and Details.

## Dashboard 1: Summary
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
Total Loan Applications: Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
Total Funded Amount: Understand the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, monitor MTD Total Funded Amount, and analyze MoM changes.
Total Amount Received: Track the total amount received from borrowers to assess cash flow and loan repayment, including MTD Total Amount Received and MoM changes.
Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitor MoM variations.
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.
Summary Visualization:
Loan Status Grid View: Gain a comprehensive overview of lending operations and monitor loan performance categorized by 'Loan Status'. This grid view provides insights into metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.
